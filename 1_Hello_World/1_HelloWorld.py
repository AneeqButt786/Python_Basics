"""
Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. 
It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code.

To print anything on is so you just have to use print() and boom its in front of you. 
For Example:
"""

print("Hello World!")

"""
Indentation
Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. 
Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires 
standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:
"""

x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")

"""
Exercise
Use the "print" function to print the line "Hello, World!".
"""

print("")
